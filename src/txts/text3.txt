Series name
For 1996–1997, the series was simply referred to as the Indy Racing League. For 1998–1999, the series garnered its first title sponsor, and was advertised as the Pep Boys Indy Racing League. In 2000, the series sold its naming rights to Internet search engine Northern Light, and the series was named the Indy Racing Northern Light Series.[2]

The name IndyCar Series was officially adopted beginning in 2003, as the series was now legally entitled to use it due to the expiration of a 1996 legal settlement with Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). The series began to progressively downplay the former IRL name, changing its name to simply IndyCar for the 2008 season. The company was similarly renamed in 2011.

Izod signed a six-year deal to become the series title sponsor beginning on November 5, 2009 through 2014,[3] but the sponsorship was terminated at the end of the 2013 season.[4] In 2014, Verizon Communications became title sponsor of the series through 2018.[5] In January 2019, it was announced that Japanese communications company NTT would become title sponsor and official technology partner of the IndyCar Series.[6] In 2023, IndyCar announced that NTT had extended their title sponsorship, for an unreported length.[7]
